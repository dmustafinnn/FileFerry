## Project Setup
1. Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed on your computer.

    docker-compose build
    ```
3. After the build is complete, start the Docker containers by running the following command:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```
4. The following table shows the ports used by each container:
    | Service | Container Name | Port |
